                Hey there! I'm Van — the person behind this little corner of the internet.
                I built this project after hearing friends talk about how chaotic swapping
                Valkyries tickets could be. I'm not a superfan in the “paint my face gold” way,
                but I <em>do</em> love watching the games and being surrounded by the incredible
                energy of queer fans. Honestly, the community is what pulled me in.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                Outside of coding things like this, I spend a lot of time with my dogs
                (they're definitely my emotional support gremlins), trying out new recipes,
                and planning my next trip even if I have zero business traveling anywhere.
                I like simple joys: the SF breeze, beautiful hikes, and those rare days when
                I actually remember to stretch.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                I also do volunteer tech work for nonprofits and community spaces. It's my
                small way of helping projects I care about thrive. If you've ever been part of
                grassroots anything, you know how much heart goes into keeping things running.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                This ticket swap started as a tiny idea and turned into something I really
                enjoyed building. If it ends up being useful to you or makes your game day
                a little better, that means a lot.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                Thanks for being here. And if you ever see me at a game — feel free to say hi.
            </p>
